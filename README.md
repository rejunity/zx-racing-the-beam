ZX 48/128 Experiments
=====

This repo contains set of experiments **racing the beam** and **opening the border** on ZX Spectrum 48K.
 - *racing the beam* - is the besis of multicolour effects that defy 8x8 color attributes,
 - *opening the border* - allows to draw outside of the normal video memory area.

Both techniques require precise cycle timing which is complicated on ZX Spectrum 48/128K due to [memory contention](https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/Contended_memory).
